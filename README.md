## THE IDEA

The name of my project is **AI-Read Outlet**.
The idea is to create a smart environment where people can buy books in a fast and pleasure way.
The problems are that in libraries we waste time in searching our favourite books, long queries for buying them and low surveillance. 
This project can solve this problems:
* Introducing a preference-based connection between rooms can reduce the books' hunt and browse directly your desired ones. This is done by a stereo camera that gathers person's image, elaborates data and send them to a computer that through an algorithm displays which room is in line with the costumer. The choice is done by selecting the icon on a screen near the door. Once selected the room, you are brung directly to the wished one. Obviously near the door there is a switch for open it.  
* To avoid long queries it is possible to buy a book simply reading the barcode on the cover, indeed in the barcode is implemented a RFID antenna which can be read by the client's phone.
* To prevent robberies, vandalisms and book's exchange on incorrect shelves, the stereo camera works also as a supervisor in combination with a PIR sensor that reacts to people who stole books. Cases are mounted on shelves that can be opened only by switching an interrupt near them.

## POSSIBLE STRUCTURE

In Fig. 1 it is illustrated a possible structure of the shop (the one described in the ontology).

The client will start from the Entrance room, passing through a PIR sensor and catched by the stereo camera
